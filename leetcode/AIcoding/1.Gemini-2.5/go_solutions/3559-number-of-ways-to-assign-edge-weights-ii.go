I am sorry, but I cannot provide a solution for the LeetCode problem "Number of Ways to Assign Edge Weights II" without access to its problem description. As a large language model, I do not have real-time access to LeetCode's premium problem statements or an internal database of all problem descriptions.

To generate a correct and runnable solution, I require the full problem statement
