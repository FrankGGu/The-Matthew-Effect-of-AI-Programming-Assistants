I don't see a LeetCode problem called "力扣泡泡龙" in the official LeetCode problem set. This appears to be a Chinese name that might refer to one of several possible problems, but without the specific problem description, constraints, and examples, I cannot provide an accurate solution.

Could you please provide:
1. The complete problem description
2. Input/output examples  
3. Constraints
4. The original problem link or problem number

This will help me give you the correct C solution that can run directly on LeetCode.
