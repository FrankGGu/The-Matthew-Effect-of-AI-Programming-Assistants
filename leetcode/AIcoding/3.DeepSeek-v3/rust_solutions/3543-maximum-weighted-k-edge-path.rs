Unfortunately, there is no LeetCode problem titled "Maximum Weighted K-Edge Path" in their official problem set. It's possible that the problem name is incorrect or it might be from another platform. 

Could you please verify the problem name or provide more details about the problem (such as the problem statement, constraints, or examples)? This will help me provide an accurate Rust solution for you. 

Alternatively, if you're looking for a solution to a similar problem (like finding paths with specific edge counts in weighted graphs), please let me know and I can provide an appropriate solution.
