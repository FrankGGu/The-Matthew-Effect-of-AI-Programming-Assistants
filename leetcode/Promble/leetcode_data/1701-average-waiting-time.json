  "content": "<p>There is a restaurant with a single chef. You are given an array <code>customers</code>, where <code>customers[i] = [arrival<sub>i</sub>, time<sub>i</sub>]:</code></p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><code>arrival<sub>i</sub></code> is the arrival time of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> customer. The arrival times are sorted in <strong>non-decreasing</strong> order.</li>\n\t<li><code>time<sub>i</sub></code> is the time needed to prepare the order of the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> customer.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>When a customer arrives, he gives the chef his order, and the chef starts preparing it once he is idle.
