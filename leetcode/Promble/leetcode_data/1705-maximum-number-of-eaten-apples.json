  "content": "<p>There is a special kind of apple tree that grows apples every day for <code>n</code> days. On the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> day, the tree grows <code>apples[i]</code> apples that will rot after <code>days[i]</code> days, that is on day <code>i + days[i]</code> the apples will be rotten and cannot be eaten. On some days, the apple tree does not grow any apples, which are denoted by <code>apples[i] == 0</code> and <code>days[i] == 0</code>.</p>\n\n<p>You decided to eat <strong>at most</strong> one apple a day (to keep the doctors away). Note that you can keep eating after the first <code>n</code> days.</p>\n\n<p>Given two integer arrays <code>days</code> and <code>apples</code> of length <code>n</code>, return <em>the maximum number of apples you can eat.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> apples = [1,2,3,5,2], days = [3,2,1,4,2]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 7\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> You can eat 7 apples:\n- On the first day, you eat an apple that grew on the first day.\n- On the second day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.\n- On the third day, you eat an apple that grew on the second day.
