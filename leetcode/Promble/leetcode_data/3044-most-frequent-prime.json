  "content": "<p>You are given a <code>m x n</code> <strong>0-indexed </strong>2D<strong> </strong>matrix <code>mat</code>. From every cell, you can create numbers in the following way:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>There could be at most <code>8</code> paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.</li>\n\t<li>Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.</li>\n\t<li>Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are <code>1, 9, 1</code>, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: <code>1, 19, 191</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Return <em>the most frequent <span data-keyword=\"prime-number\">prime number</span> <strong>greater</strong> than </em><code>10</code><em> out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or </em><code>-1</code><em> if no such prime number exists.
