  "content": "<p>You are playing a solitaire game with <strong>three piles</strong> of stones of sizes <code>a</code>​​​​​​, <code>b</code>,​​​​​​ and <code>c</code>​​​​​​ respectively. Each turn you choose two <strong>different non-empty </strong>piles, take one stone from each, and add <code>1</code> point to your score. The game stops when there are <strong>fewer than two non-empty</strong> piles (meaning there are no more available moves).</p>\n\n<p>Given three integers <code>a</code>​​​​​, <code>b</code>,​​​​​ and <code>c</code>​​​​​, return <em>the</em> <strong><em>maximum</em> </strong><em><strong>score</strong> you can get.</em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> a = 2, b = 4, c = 6\n<strong>Output:</strong> 6\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> The starting state is (2, 4, 6).
