Create a meeting room booking system using the emerging Rust stack: SolidJS for frontend and Actix Web with SeaORM for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, department, created_at
- meeting_rooms: id, name, location, capacity, amenities, is_active, created_at
- bookings: id, room_id, user_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT authentication
   - User profile management
   - Department-based organization

2. Meeting Room Management:
   - CRUD operations for meeting rooms
   - Availability checking
   - Advanced filtering capabilities

3. Booking Management:
   - Create, view, update, delete bookings
   - Time conflict detection
   - Status management with proper transitions

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: SolidJS with fine-grained reactivity
- Backend: Actix Web with JWT authentication, SeaORM as ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:meetingpass@localhost:5432/meeting_booking
- API: RESTful design with focus on performance

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Actix Web server with routes, handlers, and middleware
- SolidJS components with reactive patterns
- SeaORM entities and database operations
- Authentication system with JWT
- Build and run instructions for both frontend and backend
