Create a complete meeting room booking system using Vue 3 for frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, department, created_at
- meeting_rooms: id, name, location, capacity, amenities, is_active, created_at
- bookings: id, room_id, user_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - User registration and login (JWT authentication)
   - User profile management
   - Department-based user grouping

2. Meeting Room Management:
   - CRUD operations for meeting rooms
   - Room availability checking
   - Filter rooms by capacity, location, amenities

3. Booking Management:
   - Create, view, update, cancel bookings
   - Check room availability before booking
   - Booking status tracking (PENDING, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED)
   - Conflict detection for overlapping bookings

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API, Vue Router for navigation, Pinia for state management
- Backend: Spring Boot with Spring Security for JWT authentication, Hibernate for ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:meetingpass@localhost:5432/meeting_booking
- API: RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Spring Boot application with controllers, services, and repositories
- Vue 3 components for all features
- Proper error handling and validation
- Database configuration and entity classes
- Installation and setup instructions
