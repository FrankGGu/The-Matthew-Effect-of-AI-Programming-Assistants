You are a senior full-stack developer. Create a lightweight gym membership system using Preact frontend with Gin backend and GORM.

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- Frontend: Preact with TypeScript
- Backend: Gin framework in Go
- ORM: GORM with PostgreSQL
- Build: Go modules for backend, Vite for frontend

**DATABASE CONNECTION:**
- PostgreSQL: postgresql://postgres:gymsecret@localhost:5432/gym_management
- All tables already created

**REQUIRED FEATURES:**

1. **Membership Plan Management**
   - CRUD operations for membership plans
   - Plan listing with features

2. **Member Management**
   - Member registration and profile management
   - Member search and filtering

3. **Membership Card System**

4. **Check-in System**
   - Check-in interface
   - Check-in history and reporting

5. **Payment Processing**
   - Payment recording
   - Payment history per member

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use GORM for database operations with proper models
- Implement REST API with Gin framework
- Add input validation with Go validator
- Implement proper error handling middleware
- Preact frontend should use functional components with hooks
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Manage state with Preact signals
- Use minimalist CSS for styling (no heavy frameworks)
- Implement form handling with proper validation

**CODE STRUCTURE:**
Backend (Go + Gin):
- GORM models for all database entities
- Gin route handlers for API endpoints
- Middleware for CORS and authentication
- Service layer for business logic

Frontend (Preact + TypeScript):
- Components for each feature
- Services for API communication
- TypeScript interfaces for data models
- State management with signals

Generate the complete application with emphasis on lightweight implementation and performance.
