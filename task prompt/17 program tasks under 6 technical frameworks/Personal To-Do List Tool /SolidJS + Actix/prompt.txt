Create an emerging tech stack Personal To-Do List application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: SolidJS (reactive JavaScript library)
- Backend: Actix Web with Rust
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up in Docker)
- ORM: SeaORM

Database connection details:
- URL: postgresql://postgres:todosecret@localhost:5432/todo_db

Application requirements:
1. Frontend components (SolidJS):
   - Highly reactive todo list interface
   - Form for adding/editing todos
   - Status controls with immediate feedback
   - Date filtering options

2. Backend API endpoints (Actix Web):
   - GET /todos - Retrieve todos with query filtering
   - POST /todos - Create new todo
   - PUT /todos/{id} - Update todo
   - DELETE /todos/{id} - Soft delete todo

3. Data model (SeaORM):
   - Define entity matching existing PostgreSQL todos table
   - Use SeaORM's async capabilities
   - Implement proper database operations

4. Functionality:
   - Add todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Mark todos as completed or deleted
   - Filter by date using query parameters
   - Highly reactive UI with SolidJS

5. Implementation requirements:
   - Use SeaORM for database operations
   - Implement Actix Web with async handlers
   - Use SolidJS's fine-grained reactivity
   - Focus on performance and memory safety
   - Modern CSS styling

Generate the complete source code with:
- Actix Web server setup
- SolidJS component structure
- SeaORM entities and database connection
- Cargo.toml and package.json dependencies
- Build instructions for both Rust and JavaScript
