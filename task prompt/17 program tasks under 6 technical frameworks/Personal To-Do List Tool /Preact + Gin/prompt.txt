Create a lightweight full-stack Personal To-Do List application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Preact (lightweight React alternative)
- Backend: Gin framework for Go
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up in Docker)
- ORM: GORM

Database connection details:
- URL: postgresql://postgres:todosecret@localhost:5432/todo_db

Application requirements:
1. Frontend components (Preact):
   - Minimal todo list interface
   - Simple form for adding todos
   - Status toggle buttons
   - Basic date filtering

2. Backend API endpoints (Gin):
   - GET /todos - Retrieve todos with query parameter filtering
   - POST /todos - Create new todo
   - PUT /todos/:id - Update todo status
   - DELETE /todos/:id - Soft delete todo

3. Data model (GORM struct):
   - Define struct matching existing PostgreSQL todos table
   - Include proper GORM tags

4. Functionality:
   - Add todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Mark todos as completed or deleted
   - Filter by date using query parameters
   - Ultra-lightweight implementation

5. Implementation requirements:
   - Use GORM for database operations
   - Keep frontend minimal with Preact
   - Use Gin's lightweight routing and middleware
   - Focus on performance and small bundle size
   - Simple CSS styling

Generate the complete source code with:
- Go module structure
- Gin server setup
- Preact component structure
- GORM models and database initialization
- Build instructions for both frontend and backend
