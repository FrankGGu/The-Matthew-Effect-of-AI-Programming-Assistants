Create a full-stack Personal To-Do List application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Backend: Express.js with Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up in Docker)
- ORM: Prisma

Database connection details:
- URL: postgresql://postgres:todosecret@localhost:5432/todo_db

Application requirements:
1. Frontend components:
   - TodoList: Display filtered list of todos
   - TodoItem: Individual todo with status controls
   - TodoForm: Form for adding/editing todos
   - DateFilter: Component to filter by date

2. Backend API endpoints:
   - GET /api/todos - Get todos (with query params for filtering)
   - POST /api/todos - Create new todo
   - PATCH /api/todos/:id - Update todo (including status)
   - DELETE /api/todos/:id - Soft delete todo

3. Data model (Prisma schema):
   - Use the existing PostgreSQL database with todos table
   - Define appropriate Prisma model matching the table

4. Functionality:
   - Add todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Mark todos as completed or deleted
   - Filter by date (today, specific date, upcoming)
   - Clean, modern UI with state management

5. Implementation requirements:
   - Use Prisma for all database operations
   - Implement React hooks for state management
   - Use Express middleware for validation and error handling
   - Include responsive CSS styling
   - Set up proper project structure with separate frontend/backend

Generate the complete source code with:
- Express.js server setup
- React application structure
- Prisma schema and client configuration
- Component hierarchy
- Package.json files with dependencies
