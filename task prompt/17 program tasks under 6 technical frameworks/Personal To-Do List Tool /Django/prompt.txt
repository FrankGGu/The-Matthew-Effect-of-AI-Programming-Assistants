Create a full-stack Personal To-Do List application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Django Templates with modern JavaScript
- Backend: Django REST Framework for API
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up in Docker)
- ORM: Django ORM

Database connection details:
- ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql
- NAME: todo_db
- USER: postgres
- PASSWORD: todosecret
- HOST: localhost
- PORT: 5432

Application requirements:
1. Frontend components (Django templates with HTMX or vanilla JS):
   - Todo list view with filtering options
   - Form for adding/editing todos
   - Status toggle buttons
   - Date filter controls

2. Backend API/views:
   - REST API endpoints using DRF
   - OR Class-based views for traditional Django approach
   - Support CRUD operations with filtering

3. Data model (Django models):
   - Match the existing PostgreSQL todos table structure
   - Include appropriate field types and constraints

4. Functionality:
   - Add todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Mark todos as completed or deleted
   - Filter by date using Django ORM
   - Traditional server-rendered approach or SPA with DRF

5. Implementation requirements:
   - Use Django ORM for all database operations
   - Implement proper form validation
   - Include class-based views or API views
   - Use Django's built-in authentication or keep it simple
   - Clean, responsive UI with CSS

Generate the complete source code with:
- Django project structure
- Models, views, URLs configuration
- Templates with JavaScript functionality
- Settings configuration for database
- Requirements.txt with all dependencies
