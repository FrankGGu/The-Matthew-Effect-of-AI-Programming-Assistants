Create a university course selection system using emerging technologies:
- Frontend: SolidJS with TypeScript
- Backend: Actix Web in Rust
- ORM: SeaORM with async support
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up)

Database connection:
- URL: "postgres://postgres:university123@localhost:5432/university"

Required functionality:
1. Student authentication and profile management
2. Course browsing and search system
3. Enrollment with prerequisite validation
4. Student dashboard with schedule
5. Basic administrative functions

Implementation details:
- Use Actix Web with async handlers
- Implement JWT authentication
- Create SeaORM entities for database operations
- Build a SolidJS frontend with reactive patterns
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Include proper error handling

Generate the complete application including:
- Rust project structure with Cargo.toml dependencies
- Actix Web server configuration and routes
- SeaORM entities matching the database schema
- SolidJS components and routing
- Migration scripts if needed

Focus on Rust's safety principles and performance characteristics while leveraging SolidJS's fine-grained reactivity.
