Build a modern university course selection system using the following stack:
- Frontend: SvelteKit with TypeScript
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- ORM: SQLAlchemy with async support
- Database: PostgreSQL (pre-configured)

Database details:
- Database URL: postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:university123@localhost:5432/university

Key features to implement:
1. User authentication and authorization
2. Course catalog with advanced filtering
3. Enrollment system with real-time capacity updates
4. Student profile and schedule management
5. Administrative functions for course management

Technical requirements:
- Use FastAPI with dependency injection
- Implement asynchronous database operations
- Create a SvelteKit application with proper routing
- Use Svelte stores for state management
- Style with Tailwind CSS
- Include OpenAPI documentation

Generate the complete project with:
- FastAPI application structure with routers
- SQLAlchemy models and database session management
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- SvelteKit components and pages
- Sample data initialization script

Focus on modern Python practices and Svelte's reactivity system.
