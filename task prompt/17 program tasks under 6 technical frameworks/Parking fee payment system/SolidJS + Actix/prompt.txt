Create a parking fee payment system using emerging technologies: SolidJS frontend and Actix Web backend with SeaORM. Use the following PostgreSQL database schema:

Database schema:
- parking_lots (id, name, location, total_spaces, hourly_rate, max_daily_rate, is_active)
- parking_spaces (id, parking_lot_id, space_number, space_type, is_occupied)
- vehicles (id, license_plate, vehicle_type, is_regular_customer)
- parking_sessions (id, vehicle_id, parking_space_id, entry_time, exit_time, base_fee, discount_amount, total_amount, status)
- payments (id, parking_session_id, payment_time, amount, payment_method, status)
- discount_rules (id, rule_name, description, discount_type, discount_value, min_hours, max_hours, applicable_vehicle_types, is_active)

Required features:
1. High-performance UI with fine-grained reactivity
2. Real-time parking space monitoring
3. Efficient vehicle entry/exit processing
4. Memory-safe fee calculation implementation
5. Secure payment handling
6. Basic reporting functionality

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: SolidJS with TypeScript
- Backend: Actix Web with SeaORM
- Focus on safety and performance
- Implement JWT authentication
- Use Rust 2021 edition and modern crate ecosystem
- Generate complete project with Cargo.toml and proper module structure

Database connection:
- Database URL: postgres://postgres:parking123@localhost:5432/parking_system

Please create a complete project with proper error handling and performance optimizations.
