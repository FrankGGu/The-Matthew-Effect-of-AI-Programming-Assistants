Create a lightweight high-performance parking system using Preact frontend and Gin backend with GORM. Use the following PostgreSQL database schema:

Database schema:
- parking_lots (id, name, location, total_spaces, hourly_rate, max_daily_rate, is_active)
- parking_spaces (id, parking_lot_id, space_number, space_type, is_occupied)
- vehicles (id, license_plate, vehicle_type, is_regular_customer)
- parking_sessions (id, vehicle_id, parking_space_id, entry_time, exit_time, base_fee, discount_amount, total_amount, status)
- payments (id, parking_session_id, payment_time, amount, payment_method, status)
- discount_rules (id, rule_name, description, discount_type, discount_value, min_hours, max_hours, applicable_vehicle_types, is_active)

Required features:
1. Minimalist UI with focus on performance
2. Real-time parking space status updates
3. Fast vehicle check-in/check-out system
4. Efficient fee calculation algorithm
5. Basic payment processing
6. Simple reporting dashboard

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: Preact with minimal dependencies
- Backend: Gin framework with GORM ORM
- Focus on performance and low memory footprint
- Implement JWT authentication
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Generate complete, compilable code

Database connection:
- Use GORM with PostgreSQL driver
- Connection string: host=localhost user=postgres password=parking123 dbname=parking_system port=5432 sslmode=disable

Please create a complete project with proper package structure and build configurations.
