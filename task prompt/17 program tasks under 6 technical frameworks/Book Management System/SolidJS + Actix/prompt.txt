Create a book management system using the emerging Rust stack: SolidJS for frontend and Actix Web with SeaORM for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, role, membership_type, created_at
- books: id, title, author, isbn, publisher, publication_date, genre, total_copies, available_copies, location, is_available, created_at
- borrow_records: id, book_id, user_id, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine_amount, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - User profile management

2. Book Management:
   - CRUD operations for books
   - Availability checking
   - Advanced search capabilities

3. Borrowing Management:
   - Create, view, update, delete borrow records
   - Due date tracking and notifications
   - Fine management system

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: SolidJS with fine-grained reactivity
- Backend: Actix Web with JWT authentication, SeaORM as ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:bookpass@localhost:5432/book_management
- API: RESTful design with focus on performance

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Actix Web server with routes, handlers, and middleware
- SolidJS components with reactive patterns
- SeaORM entities and database operations
- Authentication system with JWT
- Build and run instructions for both frontend and backend
