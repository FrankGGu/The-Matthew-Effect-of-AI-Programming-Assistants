Build a quick pickup code management system using React 18 frontend, Express.js backend, and Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Use the following database schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. React frontend with modern hooks and React Router
2. Express.js backend with RESTful APIs
3. Prisma ORM for database operations
4. JWT authentication
5. Unique 6-character alphanumeric pickup code generation
6. Order status management (PENDING, READY, PICKED_UP, CANCELLED)
7. Real-time updates using WebSockets or polling
8. Admin dashboard and customer interface
9. Responsive design with modern CSS framework

Implementation requirements:
- Use TypeScript for both frontend and backend
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Include comprehensive unit and integration tests
- Use state management (Redux or Context API)
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation
- Include Prisma migrations and seed data

Generate the complete project structure including:
- React application with components and hooks
- Express.js server with routes, controllers, and middleware
- Prisma schema and migrations
- Docker configuration
- Environment configuration files
- API documentation
