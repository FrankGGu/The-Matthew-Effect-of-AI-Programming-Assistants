Create a complete quick pickup code management system using Vue 3 frontend and Spring Boot backend with Hibernate ORM. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. Frontend Vue 3 application with Composition API and Vue Router
2. Spring Boot backend with RESTful APIs
3. Hibernate ORM for database operations
4. JWT authentication for API security
5. Generate unique 6-character pickup codes (alphanumeric)
6. Order management with status updates (PENDING, READY, PICKED_UP, CANCELLED)
7. Real-time order status tracking
8. Admin dashboard for viewing all orders
9. Customer interface for order creation and status checking

Implementation requirements:
- Use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Include unit tests for critical components
- Use Vuex for state management
- Create responsive UI with Tailwind CSS or similar
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation

Generate the complete project structure including:
- Vue frontend with all components
- Spring Boot application with entities, repositories, services, and controllers
- Database configuration
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Docker configuration for easy deployment
