Develop a lightweight quick pickup code management system using Preact frontend, Gin backend, and GORM ORM with PostgreSQL. Use the following database schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. Preact frontend for minimal bundle size
2. Gin web framework backend in Go
3. GORM ORM for database operations
4. JWT authentication
5. Efficient pickup code generation (6-character alphanumeric)
6. Order status management with minimal UI
7. High-performance API endpoints
8. Admin and customer interfaces
9. Minimalist, fast-loading UI

Implementation requirements:
- Focus on performance and minimal resource usage
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Include unit tests for critical components
- Use Go modules for dependency management
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation
- Optimize for fast startup and low memory footprint

Generate the complete project structure including:
- Preact frontend with components
- Gin backend with routes, handlers, and middleware
- GORM models and database setup
- Docker configuration for lightweight deployment
- Build scripts for both frontend and backend
- Environment configuration
