Build a modern quick pickup code management system using Svelte frontend, FastAPI backend, and SQLAlchemy ORM with PostgreSQL. Use the following database schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. Svelte frontend with SvelteKit
2. FastAPI backend with asynchronous support
3. SQLAlchemy ORM with async support
4. JWT authentication
5. Unique pickup code generation (6-character alphanumeric)
6. Order status management with real-time updates
7. Automatic API documentation with FastAPI
8. Modern, reactive UI with animations
9. High-performance asynchronous operations

Implementation requirements:
- Use Python 3.10+ and modern JavaScript
- Implement proper error handling and validation with Pydantic
- Include comprehensive tests for both frontend and backend
- Use async/await throughout the backend
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation
- Include database migrations with Alembic

Generate the complete project structure including:
- SvelteKit application with components and routes
- FastAPI application with models, schemas, and endpoints
- SQLAlchemy models and database configuration
- Docker configuration with async PostgreSQL
- Automatic API documentation setup
- Environment configuration files
