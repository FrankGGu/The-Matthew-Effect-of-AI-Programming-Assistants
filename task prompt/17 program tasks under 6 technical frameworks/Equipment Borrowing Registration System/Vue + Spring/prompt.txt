Create a complete Equipment Borrowing Registration System using Vue 3 for the frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for the backend. Use PostgreSQL as the database with the following connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Frontend requirements (Vue 3 with Composition API):
1. Equipment management page: List all equipment with filter by status, add/edit equipment form
2. Borrower management page: List all borrowers, add/edit borrower form
3. Borrowing records page: Show current and historical borrowing records with filter options
4. Dashboard: Show statistics (total equipment, borrowed items, overdue items)

Backend requirements (Spring Boot):
1. RESTful API endpoints for all CRUD operations on equipment, borrowers, and borrowing records
2. Use Hibernate for ORM with proper entity mappings
3. Implement proper validation and error handling
4. Add automated status updates for overdue items

Include:
- Proper error handling on both frontend and backend
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
- Unit tests for critical backend functionality
- Instructions on how to run the application
