Create a lightweight Equipment Borrowing Registration System using Preact for the frontend and Gin framework with GORM for the backend. Use PostgreSQL with this connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Frontend requirements (Preact):
1. Minimalist UI for equipment management
2. Borrower management interface
3. Borrow/return functionality
4. Basic dashboard with key metrics

Backend requirements (Gin + GORM):
1. Create efficient REST API endpoints using Gin
2. Use GORM for database operations with proper model definitions
3. Implement middleware for request validation
4. Add automatic status updates for overdue items

Include:
- Lightweight and fast implementation
- Proper error handling
- Simple but responsive UI
- Instructions for building and running the application
