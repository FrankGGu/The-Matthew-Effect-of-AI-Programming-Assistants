Build a complete Equipment Borrowing Registration System using React 18 with functional components and hooks for the frontend, and Express.js with Prisma for the backend. Use PostgreSQL with this connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Frontend requirements (React):
1. Equipment management: List, add, edit, and filter equipment
2. Borrower management: List, add, and edit borrowers
3. Borrow/return interface with date selection
4. Dashboard with statistics and recent activities

Backend requirements (Express.js):
1. REST API with proper routing structure
2. Use Prisma for database operations with proper schema definition
3. Implement middleware for validation and error handling
4. Add automatic status updates for overdue equipment

Include:
- Modern React patterns (hooks, context for state management)
- Responsive UI with CSS modules or styled-components
- Comprehensive error handling
- API documentation
- Instructions for setup and running the application
