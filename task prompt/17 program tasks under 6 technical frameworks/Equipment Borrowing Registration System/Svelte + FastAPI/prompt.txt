Build a modern Equipment Borrowing Registration System using Svelte for the frontend and FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for the backend. Use PostgreSQL with this connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Frontend requirements (Svelte):
1. Reactive equipment management interface
2. Borrower management with smooth transitions
3. Intuitive borrow/return workflow
4. Real-time dashboard with statistics

Backend requirements (FastAPI):
1. Create FastAPI endpoints with proper Pydantic models
2. Use SQLAlchemy with async support for database operations
3. Implement automatic OpenAPI documentation
4. Add background tasks for updating overdue items

Include:
- Modern, responsive UI with Svelte animations
- Comprehensive API documentation automatically generated by FastAPI
- Proper error handling and validation
- Instructions for setup and running the application
