Develop an Equipment Borrowing Registration System using the emerging technologies: SolidJS for the frontend and Actix Web with SeaORM for the backend. Use PostgreSQL with this connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Frontend requirements (SolidJS):
1. High-performance equipment management interface
2. Reactive borrower management
3. Efficient borrow/return workflow
4. Dashboard with real-time updates

Backend requirements (Actix Web + SeaORM):
1. Create high-performance REST API using Actix Web
2. Use SeaORM for database operations with entity definitions
3. Implement proper error handling and validation
4. Add automated status updates for overdue items

Include:
- Modern, efficient UI with SolidJS fine-grained reactivity
- High-performance backend with Actix Web
- Proper error handling and validation
- Instructions for setup and running the application
- Note any emerging technology challenges and their solutions
