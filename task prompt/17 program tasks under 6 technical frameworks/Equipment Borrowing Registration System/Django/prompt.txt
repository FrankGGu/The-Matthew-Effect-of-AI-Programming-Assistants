Develop a complete Equipment Borrowing Registration System using Django REST Framework for the backend and Django templates for the frontend. Use PostgreSQL with this connection: postgresql://postgres:equipment_pass@localhost:5432/equipment_db

Database schema:
- equipment (id, name, model, serial_number, status, purchase_date, created_at, updated_at)
- borrowers (id, name, email, department, created_at)
- borrowing_records (id, equipment_id, borrower_id, borrow_date, expected_return_date, actual_return_date, status, notes, created_at)

Backend requirements (Django):
1. Create Django models for all tables with proper relationships
2. Implement Django REST Framework serializers and viewsets for all models
3. Add authentication and permission classes
4. Create API endpoints for all CRUD operations
5. Implement automatic status updates for overdue items

Frontend requirements (Django templates):
1. Equipment management interface with list and form views
2. Borrower management interface
3. Borrowing records interface with filtering options
4. Dashboard with statistics

Include:
- Proper form validation and error handling
- Responsive design with Bootstrap or similar CSS framework
- Django admin customization for data management
- Unit tests for models and API endpoints
- Instructions for setup and deployment
