Create a complete Class Roll Call System with Vue frontend and Spring Boot backend using Hibernate ORM. The system should maintain student lists, record attendance status (present/absent), and provide attendance counting by date.

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
- Students: id, student_id, first_name, last_name, email, created_at
- Attendance: id, student_id, date, status, notes, recorded_at
- Class_sessions: id, session_date, topic, created_at

**Frontend Requirements (Vue 3):**
- Student management page: List, add, edit, delete students
- Attendance recording page: Select date, mark students present/absent
- Reports page: View attendance by date, student attendance history
- Use Vue Router for navigation
- Use Vuex for state management
- Responsive design with Bootstrap or similar

**Backend Requirements (Spring Boot):**
- RESTful API with proper HTTP status codes
- JPA/Hibernate for database operations
- Data validation and error handling
- Use DTOs for data transfer
- Implement proper service layer architecture

**Key Features:**
- Record attendance for specific dates
- View attendance history by student
- Generate attendance reports by date
- Prevent duplicate attendance records for same student/date

**Database Connection:**
Use PostgreSQL with connection string: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/rollcall_db

**Code Structure:**
- Separate frontend and backend projects
- Include proper package structure for Java
- Use component-based architecture for Vue
- Include sample data initialization

**Deliverables:**
- Complete source code for both frontend and backend
- Build configuration files (Maven/Gradle)
- README with setup instructions
- API documentation
