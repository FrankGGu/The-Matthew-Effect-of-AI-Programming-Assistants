Create a Class Roll Call System using the emerging tech stack of SolidJS frontend and Actix Web backend with SeaORM. Focus on performance, safety, and modern development practices.

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
- Students: id, student_id, first_name, last_name, email, created_at
- Attendance: id, student_id, date, status, notes, recorded_at
- Class_sessions: id, session_date, topic, created_at

**Frontend Requirements (SolidJS):**
- High-performance reactive UI
- Student management interface
- Attendance recording with date selection
- Reporting features
- Modern, fast user experience

**Backend Requirements (Actix Web):**
- High-performance Actix Web server
- SeaORM for database operations
- Async/await throughout
- Proper error handling
- Rust best practices

**Key Features:**
- Manage student records
- Record attendance with present/absent status
- View attendance by date and student
- Prevent duplicate records

**Database Connection:**
Use SeaORM with PostgreSQL: postgresql://localhost:5432/rollcall_db

**Code Structure:**
- Rust with modern practices
- Async/await where appropriate
- Proper error handling
- Performance-optimized code

**Deliverables:**
- Complete Rust project with Cargo.toml
- Frontend build configuration
- SeaORM entities and migrations
- Performance benchmarks in README
