Build a lightweight book management system using Preact for frontend and Gin with GORM for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, role, membership_type, created_at
- books: id, title, author, isbn, publisher, publication_date, genre, total_copies, available_copies, location, is_available, created_at
- borrow_records: id, book_id, user_id, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine_amount, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Membership management

2. Book Management:
   - CRUD operations for books
   - Advanced search functionality
   - Copy availability tracking

3. Borrowing Management:
   - Create, view, update, delete borrow records
   - Overdue book detection
   - Fine calculation and management

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Preact with lightweight state management
- Backend: Gin framework with JWT authentication, GORM as ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:bookpass@localhost:5432/book_management
- API: RESTful design with minimal overhead

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Gin server with routes, middleware, and handlers
- Preact components with minimal dependencies
- GORM models and database operations
- Authentication system
- Build and run instructions
