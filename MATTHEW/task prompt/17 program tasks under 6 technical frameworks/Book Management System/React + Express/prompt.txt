Develop a book management system using React 18 for frontend and Express.js with Prisma for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, role, membership_type, created_at
- books: id, title, author, isbn, publisher, publication_date, genre, total_copies, available_copies, location, is_available, created_at
- borrow_records: id, book_id, user_id, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine_amount, created_at, updated_at
