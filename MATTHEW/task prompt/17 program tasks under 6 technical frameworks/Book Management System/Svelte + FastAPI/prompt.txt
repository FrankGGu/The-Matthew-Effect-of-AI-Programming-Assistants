Create a complete book management system using Vue 3 for frontend and Spring Boot with Hibernate for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, role, membership_type, created_at
- books: id, title, author, isbn, publisher, publication_date, genre, total_copies, available_copies, location, is_available, created_at
- borrow_records: id, book_id, user_id, borrow_date, due_date, return_date, status, fine_amount, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - User registration and login (JWT authentication)
   - Role management (student, teacher, librarian, admin)
   - Membership type handling

2. Book Management:
   - CRUD operations for books
   - Book availability checking
   - Filter books by title, author, genre, availability

3. Borrowing Management:
   - Create, view, update, return books
   - Check availability before borrowing
   - Borrowing status tracking (BORROWED, RETURNED, OVERDUE, LOST)
   - Automatic fine calculation for overdue books

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API, Vue Router for navigation, Pinia for state management
- Backend: Spring Boot with Spring Security for JWT authentication, Hibernate for ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:bookpass@localhost:5432/book_management
- API: RESTful design with proper HTTP status codes

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Spring Boot application with controllers, services, and repositories
- Vue 3 components for all features
- Proper error handling and validation
- Database configuration and entity classes
- Installation and setup instructions
