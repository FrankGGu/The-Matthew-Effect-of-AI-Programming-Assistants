Create a complete quick pickup code management system using Django REST Framework backend and Django template frontend with Django ORM. Use PostgreSQL with the following schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. Django backend with REST API using Django REST Framework
2. Django template frontend with modern JavaScript
3. Django ORM for database operations
4. Session-based or token authentication
5. Unique pickup code generation (6-character alphanumeric)
6. Order status management with state transitions
7. Admin interface using Django admin
8. Customer-facing order creation and tracking
9. Real-time notifications for order status changes

Implementation requirements:
- Use Django class-based views for API endpoints
- Implement proper form validation and error handling
- Include unit tests for models, views, and APIs
- Use Django templates with modern CSS framework
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation
- Include database migrations

Generate the complete project structure including:
- Django project with all apps
- Models, serializers, views, and URLs
- Templates and static files
- Django admin configuration
- Settings configuration for production and development
- Requirements.txt with all dependencies
