Create an emerging technology stack quick pickup code management system using SolidJS frontend, Actix Web backend, and SeaORM with PostgreSQL. Use the following database schema:

Database schema:
- pickup_locations (id, name, address, is_active, created_at)
- pickup_items (id, name, description, price, is_available, created_at)
- pickup_orders (id, customer_name, customer_phone, pickup_code, location_id, status, created_at, updated_at, expected_ready_time, actual_pickup_time)
- order_items (id, order_id, item_id, quantity, special_instructions)
- pickup_audit_log (id, order_id, action, performed_at, performed_by)

Required features:
1. SolidJS frontend for high-performance reactive UI
2. Actix Web backend in Rust for high concurrency
3. SeaORM for database operations
4. JWT authentication
5. Memory-safe pickup code generation (6-character alphanumeric)
6. Order status management with fine-grained reactivity
7. High-concurrency API endpoints
8. Minimal resource usage with maximum performance
9. Type-safe throughout the stack

Implementation requirements:
- Focus on memory safety and performance
- Implement proper error handling with Rust's Result type
- Include unit tests and integration tests
- Use modern Rust features and async/await
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper documentation
- Optimize for low latency and high throughput

Generate the complete project structure including:
- SolidJS application with components and stores
- Actix Web application with handlers, middleware, and routes
- SeaORM entities and database setup
- Docker configuration for Rust deployment
- Cargo.toml with all dependencies
- Environment configuration
- Migration scripts for database
