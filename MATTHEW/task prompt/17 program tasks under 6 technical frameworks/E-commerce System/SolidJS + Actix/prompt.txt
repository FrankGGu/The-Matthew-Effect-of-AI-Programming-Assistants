Create an e-commerce system using the emerging Rust stack: SolidJS for frontend and Actix Web with SeaORM for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, phone, address, created_at
- products: id, name, description, price, category, stock_quantity, image_url, is_active, created_at
- orders: id, user_id, total_amount, status, shipping_address, payment_status, created_at, updated_at
- order_items: id, order_id, product_id, quantity, unit_price
- reviews: id, product_id, user_id, rating, comment, created_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT authentication
   - User profile management
   - Address book functionality

2. Product Management:
   - CRUD operations for products
   - Real-time inventory tracking
   - Advanced search capabilities

3. Order Management:
   - Create, view, update orders
   - Shopping cart management
   - Order processing workflow

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: SolidJS with fine-grained reactivity
- Backend: Actix Web with JWT authentication, SeaORM as ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:ecopass@localhost:5432/ecommerce
- API: RESTful design with focus on performance

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Actix Web server with routes, handlers, and middleware
- SolidJS components with reactive patterns
- SeaORM entities and database operations
- Authentication system with JWT
- Build and run instructions for both frontend and backend
