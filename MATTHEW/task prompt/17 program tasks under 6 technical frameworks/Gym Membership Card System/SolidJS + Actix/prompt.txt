You are a senior full-stack developer. Create a gym membership system using the emerging Rust stack with SolidJS frontend and Actix Web backend with SeaORM.

**TECHNOLOGY STACK:**
- Frontend: SolidJS with TypeScript
- Backend: Actix Web with Rust
- ORM: SeaORM with PostgreSQL
- Build: Vite for frontend, Cargo for backend

**DATABASE CONNECTION:**
- PostgreSQL: postgresql://postgres:gymsecret@localhost:5432/gym_management
- All tables already created

**REQUIRED FEATURES:**

1. **Membership Plan Management**
   - CRUD operations for membership plans
   - Plan listing with details

2. **Member Management**
   - Member registration and profile management
   - Member directory with search

3. **Membership Card System**
   - Card creation and management
   - Status tracking and expiration

4. **Check-in System**
   - Check-in interface
   - Check-in history and reporting

5. **Payment Processing**
   - Payment recording
   - Payment history per member

**IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use SeaORM for database operations with entity definitions
- Implement REST API with Actix Web framework
- Add input validation with validator crate
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types
- SolidJS frontend should use reactive primitives
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Manage state with SolidJS stores
- Use minimalist CSS for styling
- Implement form handling with proper validation

**CODE STRUCTURE:**
Backend (Rust + Actix Web):
- SeaORM entities for all database tables
- Actix Web route handlers with JSON responses
- Middleware for CORS and error handling
- Service layer for business logic

Frontend (SolidJS + TypeScript):
- SolidJS components for each feature
- Services for API communication using fetch
- TypeScript interfaces for data models
- Reactive state management

Generate the complete application with emphasis on the emerging Rust stack and performance benefits.
