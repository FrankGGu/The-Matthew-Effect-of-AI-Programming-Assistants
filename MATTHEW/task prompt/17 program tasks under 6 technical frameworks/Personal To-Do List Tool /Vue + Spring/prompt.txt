Create a full-stack Personal To-Do List application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API
- Backend: Spring Boot 3 with Java 17
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up in Docker)
- ORM: Hibernate with JPA

Database connection details:
- URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/todo_db
- Username: postgres
- Password: todosecret

Application requirements:
1. Frontend components:
   - TodoList: Display list of todos with filters
   - TodoForm: Form to add/edit todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Status indicators for pending/completed/deleted
   - Date filter controls

2. Backend API endpoints:
   - GET /api/todos - Retrieve todos (with optional date filter)
   - POST /api/todos - Create new todo
   - PUT /api/todos/{id} - Update todo (including status changes)
   - DELETE /api/todos/{id} - Mark todo as deleted (soft delete)

3. Data model (already exists in PostgreSQL):
   - id (auto-increment)
   - title (required)
   - description (optional)
   - deadline (timestamp with timezone)
   - status (pending/completed/deleted)
   - created_at, updated_at

4. Functionality:
   - Add new todos with title, description, and deadline
   - Mark todos as completed or deleted
   - Filter todos by date (today, specific date, date range)
   - Responsive UI with clean design

5. Implementation requirements:
   - Use Spring Data JPA for database operations
   - Implement proper error handling and validation
   - Use Vue Router for navigation (if needed)
   - Include basic styling with CSS or Tailwind
   - Create separate components for maintainability

Generate the complete source code with:
- Spring Boot application structure
- Vue 3 components
- Proper package structure
- Configuration files
- Build instructions
