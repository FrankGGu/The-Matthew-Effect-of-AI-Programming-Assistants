Create a Birthday Reminder full-stack application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: React 18 with Vite and TypeScript
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- Package manager: npm or yarn

Database schema (already implemented in PostgreSQL):
- contacts (id, name, email, phone, birthday, notes, created_at, updated_at)
- settings (id, days_before_reminder, notification_method, created_at)

Core functionality required:
1. Contact Management:
   - Add new contacts with birthday (name, email, phone, birthday, notes)
   - Edit existing contacts
   - Delete contacts
   - View all contacts in a list

2. Birthday Display:
   - Show upcoming birthdays (next 30 days) on dashboard
   - Filter birthdays by month with a month selector
   - Highlight today's birthdays

3. Settings:
   - Configure days before reminder (default 7)
   - Set notification method (email, sms, both)

Technical requirements:
- Use React Router for navigation with two routes: /contacts and /upcoming
- Use React Context or Redux for state management
- Implement proper error handling with user feedback
- Use RESTful API design for backend endpoints
- Add input validation on both frontend and backend
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Use Prisma for all database operations

API endpoints needed:
- GET /api/contacts - list all contacts
- POST /api/contacts - create new contact
- PUT /api/contacts/:id - update contact
- DELETE /api/contacts/:id - delete contact
- GET /api/contacts/upcoming - get upcoming birthdays
- GET /api/contacts/month/:month - get birthdays by month (1-12)
- GET /api/settings - get current settings
- PUT /api/settings - update settings

Please generate the complete project structure with all necessary files including:
- Express.js server with TypeScript
- React components for all views
- Prisma schema and migrations
- Proper configuration files for both frontend and backend
- Docker setup if possible
