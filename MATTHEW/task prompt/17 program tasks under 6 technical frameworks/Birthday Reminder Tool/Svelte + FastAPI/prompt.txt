Create a Birthday Reminder full-stack application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Svelte with SvelteKit
- Backend: FastAPI with Python
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Styling: Tailwind CSS

Database schema (already implemented in PostgreSQL):
- contacts (id, name, email, phone, birthday, notes, created_at, updated_at)
- settings (id, days_before_reminder, notification_method, created_at)

Core functionality required:
1. Contact Management:
   - Add new contacts with birthday (name, email, phone, birthday, notes)
   - Edit existing contacts
   - Delete contacts
   - View all contacts in a list

2. Birthday Display:
   - Show upcoming birthdays (next 30 days) on dashboard
   - Filter birthdays by month with a month selector
   - Highlight today's birthdays

3. Settings:
   - Configure days before reminder (default 7)
   - Set notification method (email, sms, both)

Technical requirements:
- Use SvelteKit for the frontend with file-based routing
- Use FastAPI with automatic API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
- Use SQLAlchemy with async support for database operations
- Implement proper error handling with user feedback
- Add input validation on both frontend and backend using Pydantic models
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Take advantage of Svelte's reactivity system

API endpoints needed:
- GET /api/contacts - list all contacts
- POST /api/contacts - create new contact
- PUT /api/contacts/{id} - update contact
- DELETE /api/contacts/{id} - delete contact
- GET /api/contacts/upcoming - get upcoming birthdays
- GET /api/contacts/month/{month} - get birthdays by month (1-12)
- GET /api/settings - get current settings
- PUT /api/settings - update settings

Please generate the complete project structure with all necessary files including:
- FastAPI application with routers, models, and schemas
- SvelteKit components for all views
- SQLAlchemy models and database setup
- Proper configuration files for both frontend and backend
- Docker setup if possible
