Create a Birthday Reminder full-stack application with the following technology stack:
- Frontend: Django Templates with HTMX for interactivity
- Backend: Django with Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Database: PostgreSQL with Django ORM
- Styling: Bootstrap 5

Database schema (already implemented in PostgreSQL):
- contacts (id, name, email, phone, birthday, notes, created_at, updated_at)
- settings (id, days_before_reminder, notification_method, created_at)

Core functionality required:
1. Contact Management:
   - Add new contacts with birthday (name, email, phone, birthday, notes)
   - Edit existing contacts
   - Delete contacts
   - View all contacts in a list

2. Birthday Display:
   - Show upcoming birthdays (next 30 days) on dashboard
   - Filter birthdays by month with a month selector
   - Highlight today's birthdays

3. Settings:
   - Configure days before reminder (default 7)
   - Set notification method (email, sms, both)

Technical requirements:
- Use Django's class-based views or function-based views
- Implement Django Forms for contact creation and editing
- Use Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Add HTMX for interactive features without full page reloads
- Implement proper error handling with user feedback
- Add input validation on both frontend and backend
- Use Bootstrap 5 for responsive design

API endpoints needed:
- GET /api/contacts - list all contacts
- POST /api/contacts - create new contact
- PUT /api/contacts/<id> - update contact
- DELETE /api/contacts/<id> - delete contact
- GET /api/contacts/upcoming - get upcoming birthdays
- GET /api/contacts/month/<month> - get birthdays by month (1-12)
- GET /api/settings - get current settings
- PUT /api/settings - update settings

Please generate the complete project structure with all necessary files including:
- Django project and app structure
- Models, views, URLs, and templates
- Django REST Framework serializers and views
- Proper configuration files
- Docker setup if possible
