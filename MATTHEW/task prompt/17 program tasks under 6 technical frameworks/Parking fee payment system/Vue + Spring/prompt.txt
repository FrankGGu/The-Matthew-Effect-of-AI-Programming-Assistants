Create a complete parking fee payment system using Vue.js frontend and Spring Boot backend with Hibernate ORM. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- parking_lots (id, name, location, total_spaces, hourly_rate, max_daily_rate, is_active)
- parking_spaces (id, parking_lot_id, space_number, space_type, is_occupied)
- vehicles (id, license_plate, vehicle_type, is_regular_customer)
- parking_sessions (id, vehicle_id, parking_space_id, entry_time, exit_time, base_fee, discount_amount, total_amount, status)
- payments (id, parking_session_id, payment_time, amount, payment_method, status)
- discount_rules (id, rule_name, description, discount_type, discount_value, min_hours, max_hours, applicable_vehicle_types, is_active)

Required features:
1. Parking lot management: List, add, edit parking lots
2. Real-time parking space occupancy display with color coding (green=available, red=occupied)
3. Vehicle entry/exit tracking with automatic fee calculation
4. Payment processing integration (simulate credit card, mobile app, and cash payments)
5. Discount system application based on vehicle type and customer status
6. Reports: Daily revenue, occupancy rates, vehicle statistics

Technical requirements:
- Frontend: Vue 3 with Composition API, Vue Router for navigation, Pinia for state management
- Backend: Spring Boot with Spring Data JPA/Hibernate
- Use RESTful API design with proper HTTP status codes
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Include basic authentication with JWT
- Generate complete, runnable code with proper package structure

Database connection: 
- URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/parking_system
- Username: postgres
- Password: parking123

Please create the complete project structure with all necessary configuration files.
