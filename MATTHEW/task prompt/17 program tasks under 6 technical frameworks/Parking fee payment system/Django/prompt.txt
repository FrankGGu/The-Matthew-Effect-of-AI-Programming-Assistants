Develop a comprehensive parking management system using Django REST Framework backend and Django template frontend. Use the following PostgreSQL database schema:

Database schema:
- parking_lots (id, name, location, total_spaces, hourly_rate, max_daily_rate, is_active)
- parking_spaces (id, parking_lot_id, space_number, space_type, is_occupied)
- vehicles (id, license_plate, vehicle_type, is_regular_customer)
- parking_sessions (id, vehicle_id, parking_space_id, entry_time, exit_time, base_fee, discount_amount, total_amount, status)
- payments (id, parking_session_id, payment_time, amount, payment_method, status)
- discount_rules (id, rule_name, description, discount_type, discount_value, min_hours, max_hours, applicable_vehicle_types, is_active)

Required features:
1. Admin interface for managing all aspects of the system
2. Real-time parking space status dashboard
3. Vehicle entry and exit management with fee calculation
4. Payment processing with receipt generation
5. Reporting system with export capabilities
6. User management with different permission levels

Technical requirements:
- Use Django REST Framework for API endpoints
- Implement frontend with Django templates and Bootstrap
- Use Django ORM for database operations
- Include authentication with session management
- Implement proper form validation and error handling
- Generate complete project with requirements.txt and proper settings

Database connection:
- ENGINE: django.db.backends.postgresql
- NAME: parking_system
- USER: postgres
- PASSWORD: parking123
- HOST: localhost
- PORT: 5432

Please create a complete Django project with all necessary apps, models, views, and templates.
