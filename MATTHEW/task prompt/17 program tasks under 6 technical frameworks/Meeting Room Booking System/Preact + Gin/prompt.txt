Build a lightweight meeting room booking system using Preact for frontend and Gin with GORM for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, department, created_at
- meeting_rooms: id, name, location, capacity, amenities, is_active, created_at
- bookings: id, room_id, user_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT-based authentication
   - User profile management
   - Department-based organization

2. Meeting Room Management:
   - CRUD operations for meeting rooms
   - Availability checking
   - Filtering by various criteria

3. Booking Management:
   - Create, view, update, delete bookings
   - Time conflict detection
   - Status management

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Preact with lightweight state management
- Backend: Gin framework with JWT authentication, GORM as ORM
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:meetingpass@localhost:5432/meeting_booking
- API: RESTful design with minimal overhead

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- Gin server with routes, middleware, and handlers
- Preact components with minimal dependencies
- GORM models and database operations
- Authentication system
- Build and run instructions
