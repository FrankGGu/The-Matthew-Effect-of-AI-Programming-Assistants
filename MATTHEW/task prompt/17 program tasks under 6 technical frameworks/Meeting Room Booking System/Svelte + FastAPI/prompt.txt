Develop a modern meeting room booking system using Svelte for frontend and FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for backend. Use PostgreSQL database with the following schema:

Database schema:
- users: id, username, email, full_name, department, created_at
- meeting_rooms: id, name, location, capacity, amenities, is_active, created_at
- bookings: id, room_id, user_id, title, description, start_time, end_time, status, created_at, updated_at

Requirements:
1. User Management:
   - JWT authentication
   - User profile management
   - Department-based grouping

2. Meeting Room Management:
   - Full CRUD operations
   - Real-time availability checking
   - Advanced filtering options

3. Booking Management:
   - Create, view, edit, delete bookings
   - Conflict detection for overlapping times
   - Status management with workflow

Technical Specifications:
- Frontend: Svelte with SvelteKit for routing
- Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy as ORM, Pydantic for validation
- Database: PostgreSQL with connection string: postgresql://postgres:meetingpass@localhost:5432/meeting_booking
- API: RESTful design with OpenAPI documentation

Generate complete, runnable code including:
- FastAPI application with routes, models, and schemas
- Svelte components with reactive programming
- SQLAlchemy models and database operations
- Authentication system with JWT
- Setup and running instructions
