Create a lightweight but powerful university course selection system using:
- Frontend: Preact with TypeScript
- Backend: Gin framework in Go
- ORM: GORM for database operations
- Database: PostgreSQL (already established)

Database connection:
- dsn: "host=localhost user=postgres password=university123 dbname=university port=5432 sslmode=disable"

Essential functionalities:
1. Student registration and login
2. Course browsing and search
3. Enrollment management with capacity constraints
4. Student academic dashboard
5. Basic admin interface

Technical specifications:
- Use Gin for high-performance routing
- Implement JWT authentication
- Use GORM with structs matching database tables
- Create a minimal Preact frontend with responsive design
- Include server-side validation

Please generate:
- Complete Go module structure
- Gin routes and controllers
- GORM models for all database entities
- Preact components for all pages
- Build configuration for both frontend and backend

Emphasize performance and minimal resource usage while maintaining functionality.
