- ORM: Hibernate with JPA
- Database: PostgreSQL (already configured with tables)

Database connection details:
- URL: jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/university

Required functionalities:
1. Student management (view, add, edit students)
2. Course catalog browsing with filtering by department
3. Course registration with prerequisite checking
4. Student dashboard showing enrolled courses
5. Professor view for managing courses they teach

Implementation requirements:
- Use Spring Security for authentication (basic auth for now)
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use DTOs for API responses

- Include responsive design with Tailwind CSS

Generate the complete project structure including:
- Spring Boot application with proper package structure
- Vue 3 application with router and components
- Database entities matching the existing PostgreSQL schema
- RESTful APIs for all CRUD operations
- Sample data initialization

Focus on clean code architecture and proper separation of concerns.
