Build a modern university course selection system using the following stack:
- Frontend: React 18 with TypeScript and Vite
- Backend: Express.js with TypeScript
- ORM: Prisma for database access
- Database: PostgreSQL (already set up with schema)

Database configuration:
- Connection string: postgresql://postgres:university123@localhost:5432/university

Core features needed:
1. Student registration and profile management
2. Course catalog with search and filtering
3. Enrollment system with capacity checks
4. Academic dashboard for students
5. Administrative interface for course management

Technical requirements:
- Use React Router for navigation
- Implement state management with Zustand
- Create a RESTful API with Express.js
- Use Prisma for type-safe database operations
- Add input validation with Zod
- Style with Tailwind CSS

Please generate:
- Full project structure with separate frontend and backend
- All necessary components and pages
- API routes for all entities (students, courses, enrollments, etc.)
- Prisma schema matching the existing database
- Sample data seeding script

Ensure the code follows modern React patterns (hooks, functional components) and Express.js best practices.
