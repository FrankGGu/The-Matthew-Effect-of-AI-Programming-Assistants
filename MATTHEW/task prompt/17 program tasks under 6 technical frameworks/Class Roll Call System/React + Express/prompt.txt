Develop a Class Roll Call System using React frontend and Express.js backend with Prisma ORM. The application should manage student lists, track attendance, and provide reporting features.

**Database Schema (PostgreSQL):**
- Students: id, student_id, first_name, last_name, email, created_at
- Attendance: id, student_id, date, status, notes, recorded_at
- Class_sessions: id, session_date, topic, created_at

**Frontend Requirements (React 18):**
- Create components for student management
- Build attendance recording interface with date selection
- Implement attendance reports and statistics
- Use React Router for navigation
- Use state management (Context API or Redux)
- Modern UI with Material-UI or similar

**Backend Requirements (Express.js):**
- REST API with proper middleware
- Prisma for database operations
- Input validation and error handling
- JWT authentication (optional but recommended)
- CORS configuration

**Key Features:**
- Mark attendance with present/absent status
- View attendance by date or by student
- Prevent duplicate entries for same student/date
- Export attendance data (optional)

**Database Connection:**
Use Prisma with PostgreSQL: postgresql://localhost:5432/rollcall_db

**Code Structure:**
- Separate frontend and backend folders
- Modern React with hooks and functional components
- Proper error handling in both frontend and backend
- Environment configuration

**Deliverables:**
- Complete source code with package.json files
- Prisma schema and migration files
- Setup instructions in README
- API endpoint documentation
