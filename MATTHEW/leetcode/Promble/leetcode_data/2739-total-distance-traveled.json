  "content": "<p>A truck has two fuel tanks. You are given two integers, <code>mainTank</code> representing the fuel present in the main tank in liters and <code>additionalTank</code> representing the fuel present in the additional tank in liters.</p>\n\n<p>The truck has a mileage of <code>10</code> km per liter. Whenever <code>5</code> liters of fuel get&nbsp;used up in the main tank,&nbsp;if the additional tank has at least <code>1</code> liters of fuel, <code>1</code> liters of fuel will be transferred from the additional tank to the main tank.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the maximum distance which can be traveled.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>Note: </strong>Injection from the additional tank is not continuous.
