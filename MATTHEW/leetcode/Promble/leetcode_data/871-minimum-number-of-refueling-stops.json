  "content": "<p>A car travels from a starting position to a destination which is <code>target</code> miles east of the starting position.</p>\n\n<p>There are gas stations along the way. The gas stations are represented as an array <code>stations</code> where <code>stations[i] = [position<sub>i</sub>, fuel<sub>i</sub>]</code> indicates that the <code>i<sup>th</sup></code> gas station is <code>position<sub>i</sub></code> miles east of the starting position and has <code>fuel<sub>i</sub></code> liters of gas.</p>\n\n<p>The car starts with an infinite tank of gas, which initially has <code>startFuel</code> liters of fuel in it. It uses one liter of gas per one mile that it drives. When the car reaches a gas station, it may stop and refuel, transferring all the gas from the station into the car.</p>\n\n<p>Return <em>the minimum number of refueling stops the car must make in order to reach its destination</em>. If it cannot reach the destination, return <code>-1</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note that if the car reaches a gas station with <code>0</code> fuel left, the car can still refuel there. If the car reaches the destination with <code>0</code> fuel left, it is still considered to have arrived.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 1:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> target = 1, startFuel = 1, stations = []\n<strong>Output:</strong> 0\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can reach the target without refueling.\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 2:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> target = 100, startFuel = 1, stations = [[10,100]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> -1\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> We can not reach the target (or even the first gas station).\n</pre>\n\n<p><strong class=\"example\">Example 3:</strong></p>\n\n<pre>\n<strong>Input:</strong> target = 100, startFuel = 10, stations = [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]]\n<strong>Output:</strong> 2\n<strong>Explanation:</strong> We start with 10 liters of fuel.\nWe drive to position 10, expending 10 liters of fuel.
