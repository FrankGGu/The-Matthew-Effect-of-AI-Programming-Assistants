Unfortunately, I couldn't find a LeetCode problem titled "Find the Median of the Uniqueness Array." It's possible that the problem name might be different or it might be from a different coding platform.

Could you please:
1. Verify the exact problem name on LeetCode?
2. Or provide the problem description if it's from another source?

This will help me provide you with an accurate Racket solution that works on the specified platform.
