Unfortunately, there is no LeetCode problem titled "Find Minimum Time to Reach Last Room I" in their official problem set. It's possible that the problem name is incorrect or it might be from a different platform or contest.

If you can provide the correct problem name or describe the problem in more detail (including constraints, input/output examples, etc.), I'd be happy to help you with a Go solution for it. 

Alternatively, if you're looking for a solution to a similar problem (like finding the minimum time to reach the last cell in a grid or similar), please let me know and I can provide an appropriate solution.
